// FAQ DATA
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

const faqs = [
  {
    q: "What format are the programs? PDF, video, app?",
    a: "Programs are delivered as a structured digital manual (PDF + web access). Every exercise includes written cues, progression paths, and pro tips. No app subscription needed — lifetime access means you own it forever.",
  },
  {
    q: "I have zero experience with calisthenics. Where do I start?",
    a: "Start with Planche Foundation. It's designed from absolute zero — the first 3 weeks build the connective tissue and scapular control you need before attempting any skill. If physique is your main goal with no skill focus, start with Full Hypertrophy instead.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a gym or special equipment?",
    a: "For skill programs (Planche, Front Lever), you need parallettes or a pull-up bar — both under $50. For Hybrid Athlete and Full Hypertrophy, there are dual tracks: one fully bodyweight (floor only), one for gym access. You pick what fits your setup.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long until I see real results?",
    a: "Most athletes notice strength changes within 2–3 weeks and visible skill progression by Week 4–6. The programs are designed for measurable results at every phase — you'll be testing and recording holds so you can see the exact progress over time.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if the program is too hard or too easy?",
    a: "Every exercise includes a progression path (easier and harder variants). If the main exercise is too hard, the previous progression step is listed. If too easy, the next step is there. The program adapts to where you actually are — not where you think you should be.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there any support if I have questions?",
    a: "Yes — you get direct access via email. Questions about form, programming adjustments, or exercise substitutions are answered personally. This isn't an automated bot response system.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I run multiple programs at the same time?",
    a: "Generally no — one primary program at a time. The exception is the Hybrid Athlete, which is specifically designed to combine skill and strength work. The Bundle includes guidance on how to sequence programs intelligently over a 6–12 month period.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the refund policy?",
    a: "If you complete the first 2 weeks of the program and aren't seeing any progress or finding value, reach out within 30 days for a full refund. The program works if you work it — that's the only condition.",
